These simulations examine the instantaneous throughput under various timing plans, red clear times and accelerations for simple one intersection networks.

The 2minplan folder contains simple stand-alone examples with various ACC, Manual vehicle penetratoin rates 

The Throughput folder contains two runner files - one for a double intersection case and one for a single intersection case. Platooning is also possible with the platoon_functions and settings file.
